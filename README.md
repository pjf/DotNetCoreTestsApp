This is me futzing around with a dotnet core install.

I'm doing the tutorial by @todthomson at https://github.com/todthomson/intro-to-linux-dotnetcore-docker/

You can consider all the things I've done here to be CC-0. Use as you wish!

## Getting started

- [Install dotnet core](https://github.com/todthomson/intro-to-linux-dotnetcore-docker/blob/master/Part3.md).
- `dotnet restore`
- `dotnet build`
- `dotnet run`

You should get a hello world!
